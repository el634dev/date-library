Date library is a JS library which provides straight-forward, powerful functions for working with the Date Object in JavaScript. Although originally builted into JavaScript and can be called by using `new Date()`, it can also be used with other objects and for other purposes. A TypeScript version will be included in the main library that should available for use automatically.
